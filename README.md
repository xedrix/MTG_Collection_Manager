# Magic: The Gathering Collection Manager

This project has one goal: to make it easier to manage your own MTG collection, specifically when you want to downsize.
It's super time-consuming to get rid of cards since most people need to get rid of hundreds of cards at a time
(or more ðŸ‘€). Currently at least here in Canada, there are no stores that allow you to dump a file with a list of your
cards and tell you in one go if:
1. They want it 
2. What price they'll give you for it

Because of this, you're stuck either giving one store the whole pile and hope you get a good deal or spend hours on end
manually searching at each store, one card at a time. If you're interested in reading more planned features, head to the
[high level project plan](https://github.com/xedrix/MTG_Collection_Manager/wiki/High-level-Project-Plan) on the repo's
wiki.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes. This is clearly not ready for live deployment however instructions on that will come in due time.

### Prerequisites

Only requirements at the moment are:
* Python (this is developed and tested with 3.10 but 3.6 and later *should* work)
* Some sort of list of cards pulled from [Delver Lens (Android-only)](https://www.delverlab.com/),
[Helvault (iOS-only)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/helvault-mtg-card-scanner/id1466963201) with future plans to support
[TappedOut](https://tappedout.net/) and [Moxfield](https://www.moxfield.com/)

### Installing

1. If you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed on your machine, open a
terminal and type in "git clone https://github.com/xedrix/MTG_Collection_Manager" 
2. If you don't, navigate to the [home page](https://github.com/xedrix/MTG_Collection_Manager) of the project and click
on the green "Code" button, then on "Download ZIP"
3. Extract all the files in a directory of your choice (it's recommended to make a new folder to house all these files)
